<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I always wanted to do a carousel in Javascript. This project is almost ready, it is a site selling luxury cars. I divided the project into several parts, I did 4 of the 6 parts, I divided my project as follows: <br>
<b>Navigation bar:</b> It is fixed at the top of the screen, I'm thinking of putting more information on it, for example a navigation bar, where along with an API, the user will be able to search for a car. <br>
<b>Main or main part:</b> It is under the Navigation bar, it has 3 articles that contain an image of a car along with a description, which when hovering the mouse over the image it expands. I'm thinking of making this part the place of the best car brands, where the user will be able to see the cars of each specific brand. <br>
<b>The carousel part:</b> It is under the Main and has 3 images with a descriptive text on the right side, I quite liked how it looked and I'm thinking of making the images have the hover effect and have the link functionality and take the user to the page of this car. <br>
<b>The form part:</b> It is at the bottom of the carousel, contains only the types of inputs with basic information, I am thinking of making the form more complete, based on the draft form that I did in the past. <br>
<b>The Footer part:</b> The footer part contains only my name (author's name) and the year, I'm not thinking of doing anything specific with it, maybe I'll use the links I used in my instagram clone project.
